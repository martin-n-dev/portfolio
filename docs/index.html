                    I’m a software developer and university student who works mainly in integrations and middleware. Most of what I do is about getting different systems to talk to each other in a way that is reliable, understandable, and doesn’t fall apart the moment one piece changes.

                    In practice that means working with APIs, platforms, and the odd bit of legacy, then turning that into something predictable: clear data flows, defined contracts, and automation around build and deploy so things break less and are easier to debug when they do. Outside of work and assignments, I spend time stripping down Linux environments, experimenting with ARM-based setups, and thinking about how to design systems that can run for a long time without constant cloud or vendor hand-holding.

                    I learn by taking things apart, asking blunt questions, and tightening edge cases until I trust how the system behaves. I care more about clarity and robustness than flashy solutions, and I try to bring that mindset into my projects and study. Long term, I want to use that mix of low-level understanding and integration experience to build systems that are easier for other people to work with, not harder.
