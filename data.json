    "aboutMe":"I enjoy making systems talk to each other without falling apart, I also design REST APIs, writing specs (OAS3, RAML) and create JSON schemas. This lets me wire APIs, existing platforms, and legacy systems into something predictable and maintainable. I analyze and work with the constraints of a platform or system, tightening up edge cases, and using automation (GitHub Actions, CI/CD) so deployments are more robust. \n\nOutside of work, I pull things apart to see how they actually work and right now that means experimenting with Linux, stripping down distros to the bare minimum and working up. Eventually I want to work more with embedded programming as I enjoy the physical side of coding; electronics, robotics, etc.",
